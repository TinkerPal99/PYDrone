1. First things First

3. Important informations


__First things First__
This is a control-software, build to control different Drones, Rovers and things alike.
The blue-prints for these devices aren't online now and probably never will. 

The actual __init__ can be found in main/py-scripts
The webinterface can be found in main, called Index.php

__Preparation__
For using the webinterface you need a php-runner.

__Important informations__

In the moment I am trying to rrebuild the whole system oop, first try can be found in main/py-scripts/PiTank.py and autonomousDrive.py
